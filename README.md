# Copy of ![LittleJS Logo](favicon.png) LittleJS - The Tiny JavaScript Game Engine That Can

## All aboard!

LittleJS is a super lightweight JavaScript game engine with a fast hybrid rendering system. It provides everything necessary to make amazing games, including rendering, physics, particles, sound effects, music, input handling, and debug tools. LittleJS is designed to be extremely small yet powerful enough for a variety of applications, from game jams to commercial releases. The code is very well documented with a variety of examples to get you started. Choo-Choo! ðŸš‚

- Input processing system with keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and touch support
- Particle effects system (particle editor/designer in progress)
- Medal system tracks and displays achievements with Newgrounds and OS13k integration
- Several easy to understand example projects you can build on
- Debug tools and debug rendering system
- [Full documentation](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/docs) automatically generated from the source code block tags with [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc)
- Build system automatically combines everything, minifies, and removes unused code
- For size coding competitions like [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/), starter project builds to a 7KB zip file
- (https://github.com/lifthrasiir/roadroller)
- Easily build a Windows executable with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for distribution on platforms like Steam
- Open Source with the [MIT license](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/LICENSE) so it can be used for anything you want

## Builds

To easily include LittleJS in your game, you can use one of the 3 pre-built js files. These are also built automatically by the build scripts..

- [engine.all.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/engine/engine.all.js) - The full game engine with debug mode available
- [engine.all.release.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/engine/engine.all.release.js) - The engine optimized for release builds
- [engine.all.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/engine/engine.all.min.js) - The engine in release mode and minified

The hello world example includes a batch file [build.bat](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build.bat) that compresses everything into a tiny zip file using Google Closure, UglifyJS, Roadroller, and ECT. You must run [buildSetup.bat](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/buildSetup.bat) to install the necessary npm dependencies.
